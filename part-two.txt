Part Two Database Project:

Goal is to keep track of people who have multiple addresses and multiple phone numbers


Please create a relational database schema and show examples of the following queries:


- Display people and their phone numbers

- Display people and their addresses

- Display people and their addresses only if they are in the state of California

- Show how many people have addresses in each state

- Show the % of people that have multiple addresses

**** SQL queries ****

1. Display people and their phone numbers

    SELECT people.firstName, people.lastName, phoneNumbers.number from people join peoplePhoneNumbers on(people.id = peoplePhoneNumbers.personId) join phoneNumbers on (peoplePhoneNumbers.phoneNumberId = phoneNumbers.id);

2. Display people and their addresses

    SELECT people.firstName, people.lastName, addresses.streetnameNumber from people join peopleAddresses on(people.id = peopleAddresses.personId) join addresses on (peopleAdresses.addressrId = addresses.id);

3. Display people and their addresses only if they are in the state of California
    
    SELECT people.firstName, people.lastName, addresses.streetnameNumber from people join peopleAddresses on(people.id = peopleAddresses.personId) join addresses on (peopleAdresses.addressrId = addresses.id) where addresses.state = 'CA';

4. Show how many people have addresses in each state

5. Show the % of people that have multiple addresses
